# PrintTriangleToConsole
Lang(C++) Using a function, the program prints a triangle to console. The revisions made were at first a left justified triangle. Then spacing was considered and the triangle became right justified. Lastly the triangle was doubled in size to give the appearance of a centered triangle.
